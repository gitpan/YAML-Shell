NAME
    ysh - The YAML Test Shell

SYNOPSIS
     ysh [options]

DESCRIPTION
    This program is designed to let you play with the Perl YAML modules in
    an interactive way. When you to type in Perl, you get back YAML. And
    vice versa.

    By default, every line you type is a one line Perl program, the return
    value of which will be displayed as YAML.

    To enter multi-line Perl code start the first line with ';' and use as
    many lines as needed. Terminate with a line containing just ';'.

    To enter YAML text, start with a valid YAML separator/header line which
    is typically '---'. Use '===' to indicate that there is no YAML header.
    Enter as many lines as needed. Terminate with a line containing just
    '...'.

    To read in and process an external YAML file, enter '< filename'. The
    ysh will also work as a standalone filter. It will read anything on
    STDIN as a YAML stream and write the Perl output to STDOUT. You can say
    (on most Unix systems):

        cat yaml.file | ysh | less

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
    -MYAML::Module
        Set the YAML implementation module you wish.

    -l  Keep a log of all ysh activity in './ysh.log'. If the log file
        already exists, new content will be concatenated to it.

    -L  Keep a log of all ysh activity in './ysh.log'. If the log file
        already exists, it will be deleted first.

    -r  Test roundtripping. Every piece of Perl code entered will be Dumped,
        Loaded, and Dumped again. If the two stores do not match, an error
        message will be reported.

    -R  Same as above, except that a confirmation message will be printed
        when the roundtrip succeeds.

    -i<number>
        Specify the number of characters to indent each level. This is the
        same as setting $YAML::Indent.

    -ub Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseBlock = 1'. Force multiline scalars
        to use 'block' style.

    -uf Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseFold = 1'. Force multiline scalars
        to use 'folded' style.

    -uc Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseCode = 1'. Allows subroutine
        references to be processed.

    -nh Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseHeader = 0'.

    -nv Shortcut for setting '$YAML::UseVersion = 0'.

    -v  Print the versions of ysh and the YAML implementation module in use.

    -V  In addition to the -v info, print the versions of YAML related
        modules.

    -h  Print a help message.

  YSH_OPT
    If you don't want to enter your favorite options every time you enter
    ysh, you can put the options into the "YSH_OPT" environment variable. Do
    something like this:

        export YSH_OPT='-i3 -uc -L'
